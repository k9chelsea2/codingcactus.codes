            <h3>HiðŸ‘‹</h3>
			<h4>Info</h4>
			<p>
				As you have hopefully worked out by now, I am CodingCactus and I program things! Python is what I tend to use most of the time, it's definitely the language that I know the most about, however I can program decently in JS and CSS, although some people would definitely argue over my CSS ability (really it's the lack of design ideas rather than not having the ability to do it). Mainly I make webapps with flask and discord bots as you can see from my <a href="#projects">projects</a>. Most of my projects are done on <a href="https://repl.it">repl.it</a> as it is super simple free hosting and I don't need to do whatever you are supposed to do to get vscode to work. This is me on repl.it: <a href="https://repl.it/@CodingCactus">https://repl.it/@CodingCactus</a> and I am a <a href="https://repl.it/talk">repl talk</a> content creator and moderator, basically meaning that I delete all the spammers and occasionally post decent things on repl talk.
			</p>

			<h4>Other</h4>
			<p>
				Of course, cacti are quite a large interest of mine, but that is not all! I also find maths, physics, and electronics (pretty much anything with numbers) super interesting and fun, although that's pretty much it.

			<h2>Classrooms</h2>

			<h3>Overview</h3>
			<p>
				Repl.it shut down their classrooms product leaving my school with no efficient way of teaching students how to code. I decide to take it upon myself to create a replacement for us. It uses replauth and embeds repls for students to work in. It is of course no rival to the old classrooms, but it does have working useful features - such as creating classrooms, inviting students/teachers, making assignments, submitting assignments, and giving feedback on assignments.

			<h2>Cactus Bot</h2>

			<h3>Overview</h3>
			<p>
				Inspired by <a href="https://repl.it/@Coder100">Coder100</a>'s Chocolate Bot - and other similar discord bots - I decided to make my own, cactus themed, discord currency bot! It's my first of many discord bots, but still my favourite. It's in its third version now, starting of just using files, and then repldb, and now easypydb. Each version with speed and feature improvements. You can grow and buy things from the shop to increase by how much you grow each time.

				<h2>TODO List</h2>

				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					This project came simply from a <a href="https://repl.it/talk">repl talk</a> weekly challenge. All you had to do: make some form of TODO list application. It features the ability to create, mark as complete, and delete items in your TODO list. It also has deadline functionality, where you can enter by when you must have a certain item done by.

				<h2>Password Vault</h2>

				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					Again, a project from  a <a href="https://repl.it/talk">repl talk</a> weekly challenge. This time a password vault. You can enter passwords and what site/app they are for and it will save them for you so if you forget them, you can just take a look in your vault. But what if you changed you password for a site? No worries! You can easily edit and delete passwords after making them.

				<h2>How To Python</h2>

				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					this project is a website covering all the basics of how to program in python. Basically I was bored one lunchtime with a computer science test a week or so away, and I thought I would make something to help my fellow classmates in the upcoming exam. It covers everything form printing, to looping and string/list manipulation. It also has a dark theme option!

				<h2>Cactus Clicker</h2>

				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					On everyone's journey of learning web development, they make a clicker game. Cactus clicker is mine! Simply click the cactus to gain cacti. When you have enough cacti, you can buy upgrades to either increase your cacti per click, or your cacti per second. It uses local storage to save your stats, so you won't lose everything once you leave the page.

				<h2>Typing Speed Test</h2>

				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					Test your typing speed with this console typing test. Uses getkey module to detect your key press and then checks if it is the correct letter. Uses ansi codes to colour and underline the letter that you are on. Calculates your speed and accuracy. If you repeat the test it keeps track of your previous scores so that your average speed and accuracy can be calculated for you.

				<h2>2048</h2>

				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					Play the classic 2048 game in your console! Again uses getkey module to detect key presses, controls are simply your usual wasd keys. Blocks are displayed using ascii characters and what you need to to is put blocks of the same number together, this combines them into one block of double value. The goal is to get a 2048 block. A tip is to move the blocks in only three directions to try and keep the larger blocks close to each other.

			<h2>Tic Tac Toe</h2>

			<h3>Overview</h3>
			<p>
				One of my first projects! If you're ever bored and just want to play some tic tac toe against a friend or bot, this is for you! As I said, this is one of my first projects, so if you just want to laugh at some bad code, this is also for you. There are 3 difficulty levels of difficulty against the bot: easy - just plays in a random spot and defends 3 in a row, hard - only one possible way to win involving luck, impossible - every single possibility hard coded.
